# Navigation
- Installing Navigation Package
- npm install @react-navigation/native

## Installing Stack Navigator
- npm install @react-navigation/stack
- 

- In this section we are going t learn Navigation from one screen to another screen
- Usually mobile platform uses one screen ata time to show content
- TO get started with installation
- npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
- Next, install the required peer dependencies. You need to run different commands depending on whether your project is an Expo managed project or a bare React Native project.
- If you have an Expo managed project, install the dependencies with expo:
    - expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
- If you have a bare React Native project, install the dependencies with npm:
    - npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
- Once installation done, now use this below command for IOS
    - pod install

- Now, you need to wrap the whole app in NavigationContainer. Usually you'd do this in your entry file, such as index.js or App.js:
```
import * as React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
const App = () => {  
return (    
<NavigationContainer>      
{/* Rest of your app code */}    
</NavigationContainer>  
);};
export default App;
```

```
import * as React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();
const MyStack = () => {  
return (    
<NavigationContainer>      
<Stack.Navigator>        
<Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} options={{ title: 'Welcome' }} />        
<Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />      
</Stack.Navigator>    </NavigationContainer>  );};
```

## Stable Navigation version 5.0
- Key changes and new features included in React Navigation 5.0 include:
- Dynamic, component-based configuration
- New hooks for common use cases, including useNavigation, useRoute, and useNavigationState
- A new setOptions method that makes configuring screen navigation options more intuitive
- Revamped theme system for easier customization
- First-class autocompletion and type-checking with TypeScript
- Redux DevTools integration
- Native stack navigator that uses native navigation primitives for navigation using react-native-screens
- New backends for Material top tab navigator based on react-native-viewpager and ScrollView

## createStackNavigator
```
const AppNavigator = createStackNavigator({
  Home: {
    screen: HomeScreen
  },
  About: {
    screen: AboutScreen
  }
},{
        initialRouteName: "Home"
});
```
- The createStackNavigator function passes behind the scenes, a navigate prop to the HomeScreen and AboutScreen components. 
- The navigate prop allows for navigation to a specified screen component. This is why we are able to use it on a button at HomeScreen.js, which, when pressed, leads to the AboutScreen page, as shown below.
```
<Button title="Go to About" 
onPress={() => this.props.navigation.navigate('About')}
/>
```

## Using tab navigation
```
const AppNavigator = createBottomTabNavigator({
  Home: {
    screen: HomeScreen
  },
  About: {
    screen: AboutScreen
  },
  Contact: {
    screen: ContactScreen
  }
}, {
  initialRouteName: "Home"
});
```

## Using drawer navigation
```
const AppNavigator = createDrawerNavigator({
  Home: {
    screen: HomeScreen
  },
  About: {
    screen: AboutScreen
  },
  Contact: {
    screen: ContactScreen
  }
}, {
    initialRouteName: "Home"
  });
```
