# Component


## Hooks
- Hooks are great for stateful logic and code organization. Now we have several hooks for common use cases:
- [useNavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation/)
- [useRoute](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-route/)
- [useNavigationState](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation-state/)
- [useFocusEffect](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-focus-effect/)
- [useIsFocused](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/)
- [useScrollToTop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-scroll-to-top/)
